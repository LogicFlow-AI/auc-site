The trip to Madang is a self-funded experience costing approximately $2500 for travel/insurance. Accommodation and food details are being finalised and will be forwarded to all interested personnel ASAP.

Note that the dates fall in the dry season in PNG, but still the average temperature is around 30°C, 84% humidity and up to 15 days rainfall of 144mm. The UV index is 11. The first week that we will be there corresponds with the last week of their school holidays, so that is when the Kids Club will operate.
