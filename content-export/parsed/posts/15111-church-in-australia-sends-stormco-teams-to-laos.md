<p>The Seventh-day Adventist church in Australia (AUC) has continued to support mission in Laos by sending STORMCo volunteers to three different locations from July 1 to 21.</p>

<p>Service To Others Really Matters (STORMCo) is an initiative that allows youth and young adults to visit and serve communities, presenting Christian faith in action and building long-term relationships.</p>

<p>The mission trip is part of an annual initiative by the Australian Union Conference (AUC) as part of their global mission partnership program with the Southeastern Asian Union Mission and Timor Leste. It was the second of its kind to be run in Laos.</p>

<p>The first group, a small team of four volunteers, including staff from the AUC, was hosted by Eliyah Language Centre (ELC), which facilitates English language classes for local high school and university-aged students. While there, the team hosted teacher training sessions and participated in team-building activities.</p>

<p>Six volunteers from Melbourne and Canberra, who formed the second group, were hosted by Phonsivan’s Namtipsavan Bilingual School, a kindergarten, primary school—up to grade 5—and an English language centre located in Xiangkhouang Province. The team conducted a STORMCo/VBS program for more than 100 junior and teen young people in attendance.The third group, formed by 10 student volunteers from Avondale University, was hosted by Namtipsavan English Language Center in Luangprabang Province. While there, the team conducted a STORMCo program, trained teachers and assisted in the classrooms.</p>

<p>Participant Eh Tha Yu Soe said the experience was transformative. “When I first heard about the STORMCo trip to Laos, I was thrilled. The experience turned out to be even more amazing than I had imagined. I loved everything about the trip: the friendly people, the happy kids, my wonderful team, and of course, the delicious food.”</p>

<p>She also encouraged others to join the project. “If you’re looking to serve and also want to experience a new culture and travel to a different part of the world, I would recommend STORMCo”</p>
