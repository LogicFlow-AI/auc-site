<p>Ten people from the Aboriginal community of Wujal Wujal (Qld), located 71 kilometres south of Cooktown, became members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church on September 3. The nine baptisms and one profession of faith were the result of ongoing ministry over the past six years, supported through Global Mission funds.</p>

<p>A highlight from the baptism was the testimony of baptismal candidate Dion Williams, who has a history of substance abuse and, before knowing Jesus, described himself as an “angry person.”</p>

<p>During the program, Mr Williams shared a video of his “cardboard testimony”. Recorded at Mamarapha College, the video is a visual account where he used pieces of cardboard to highlight key moments from his life before and after finding Jesus.</p>

<p>Currently studying pastoral ministry at Mamarapha, Mr Williams is also a full-time carer for his brother, who has a disability. Since getting to know Jesus, Mr Williams has been a source of encouragement and support to those around him.</p>

<p>Mareeba Adventist Church elder and former Northern Australian Conference Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ministries director Pastor Eddie Hastie said Mr Williams’ journey is a “testament to the power of faith. His life has been transformed and the community can clearly see the positive change that Jesus has brought into his life.”</p>

<p>“Dion’s cardboard testimony speaks volumes about his journey. It tells of his life before he found Jesus and the joy he now experiences in following God,” Pastor Hastie explained. “His story serves as an inspiration to all who witness it, reminding us that faith can truly transform lives for the better,” Pastor Hastie said.</p>
