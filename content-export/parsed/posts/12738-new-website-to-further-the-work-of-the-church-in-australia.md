<p>Adventist.org.au is a complete overhaul of the old website, with emphasis on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and visual design elements to attract members of the public to learn more about the Adventist Church.</p>

<p>Users can sign up to access Bible study resources, find their nearest church and keep up to date with the latest news and events.</p>

<p>Australian Union Conference (AUC) media and ministerial association secretary Pastor Murray Hunter said, “We are very excited about the launch of our new website. The creators have been diligently working on the site over the past months to ensure that end users have a great experience.”</p>

<p>According to him, the new website will also provide access to resources and information that will help further the work of the Church in Australia and “facilitate the ease of access to sites that make up what is deemed our Australian Adventist church digital and physical network”, said Pastor Murray.</p>
