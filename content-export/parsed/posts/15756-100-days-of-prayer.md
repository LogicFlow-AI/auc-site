<h2 class="tb-heading" data-toolset-blocks-heading="3a94a5f5ac99f0c5642cb0af3ba9a028" data-last-update="1.4">Welcome to<strong> 100 Days of Prayer</strong></h2>
We are living in a world full of digital distractions, consuming cares, busyness, and broken down altars of worship. If you are feeling in need of a fresh re-boot in your spiritual journey, desiring to rebuild or strengthen your altar of worship, longing for more Holy Spirit revival fire to be poured out on your life, or simply looking for an evangelistic tool to bring others to a deep relationship with Jesus, you’ve come to the right place.
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><em>“Then Elijah said to all the people, ‘Come near to me.’ So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD [that was] broken down.” <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/1%20Kings%2018.30;nkjv?t=biblia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-reference="1 Kings 18.30" data-version="nkjv" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Kings 18:30</a></em></blockquote>
Over the course of fourteen weeks (<strong>April 4 – July 12, 2025</strong>), we will be praying for an outpouring of the Latter Rain on our world church, growing together as disciples for the Kingdom, and preparing our hearts for Jesus’ soon return.

Each Friday morning, during the <strong>Back to the Altar | 100 Days of Prayer</strong>, all those registered will receive an e-mail which will include:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>A short revival or miracle testimony to build faith</li>
 	<li>A short but packed inspirational Back to the Altar themed Bible study
<ul>
 	<li>This study will include fun interactive activities and questions that one can do alone, with friends/family, the church, or a small group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>It will include personal heart challenges and inspiring video illustrations.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>It will include practical spiritual disciplines to incorporate into your daily life, as well as much, <em>much </em>more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Participants can sign up to receive a daily “prayer focus” on WhatsApp.</li>
 	<li>Those who desire can also participate in a 1 hour weekly revival session on zoom hosted by members of the Back to the Altar leadership team. This revival session will take place every Sunday at 6:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (10:00 UTC) and will be in English.</li>
</ul>
