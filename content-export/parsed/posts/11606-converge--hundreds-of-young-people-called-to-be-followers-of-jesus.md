<p>Pastor Stojkovic challenged the youth to be followers of Jesus, not just fans, while Pastor Stiles spoke about what it means to neighbour well, based on the parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10:25-27. She challenged the audience to think about how they can be better neighbours to those of different faith and culture to them.</p>

<p>Greater Sydney Conference youth director Pastor Simon Gigliotti is a regular at the event and sees the impact it has on young people’s lives. “This was my sixth Converge. All the way through, the call to young people here has been to step up and live for Jesus, and in particular, to live missional lives.”</p>
