<p>Around 13 volunteers from across Australia and New Zealand are preparing to travel to Cairo, Egypt, from June 21 to July 7 to host a Pathfinder Camporee at the Nile Union Academy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Egypt-Sudan Field (ESF) of Seventh-day Adventists has requested the help of volunteers to assist in leading out in worship, music and other activities related to Pathfinders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program will include guest speaker youth liaison Pastor Nick Kross, who will be taking annual leave to join the group and will speak on the theme of “Walking in Faith”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team will lead out in pathfinder activities, worship and praying for the youth of different faith communities who attend the Adventist mission school in Cairo.</p>

<p>Pastor Kross continued, “It’s our privilege and honour to pioneer such a life-changing ministry like Pathfinders in Egypt. Lives will be changed at this camporee as young Pathfinders accept Jesus’ offer of eternal life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Established in Egypt in 2014, Pathfinders is a new ministry there and lacks support from local churches. As a result, the ESF relies on foreign leaders to train and equip their local leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pastor Kross said, “I see real value in supporting our church family in other Divisions where the Pathfinder movement is still in its infancy. As Jesus once said, ‘As the father has sent me, so I am sending you’ (John 20:21)” .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to covering their own costs, the group have been asked to raise $A15,000 to support the ESF, as they have access to limited resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are plans for the ESF to run a camporee every two years with the help of other foreign Divisions and Conferences.</p>
