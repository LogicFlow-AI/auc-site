<p>Students from Adventist schools across Australia are being encouraged to unleash their creativity, with the chance to win cash prizes in a competition that celebrates the joy of the Sabbath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students are asked to draw a poster, take a photograph, write a poem, build a Lego brick sculpture—or come up with any other creative work of their choice—to illustrate what they love about the Sabbath. Cash prizes are being offered for each year group, from Pre-School to Year 12.</p>

<p>The competition is the latest phase of the&nbsp;<a href="https://record.adventistchurch.com/2023/08/28/sabbath-gift-reaches-1-4-million/">Sabbath Gift promotion</a>, which was launched in June with the aim of highlighting the benefits of the Sabbath as a time for rest and restoration, community and connection in today’s fast-paced and often isolating world. And, most importantly, it’s about sharing that the Sabbath is a precious gift from a loving God.</p>

<p>“We are delighted to broaden the horizons of the Sabbath Gift initiative by teaming up with Adventist Schools Australia in a competition designed to get kids thinking about the Sabbath and why it’s amazing,” said South Pacific Division communication director Tracey Bridcutt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So if you’re a student, here’s your chance to get creative in whatever medium you choose. And if you’re a parent, grandparent or friend of a student, please encourage them to get involved.”</p>

<p>Entries close on September 30. All the competition details can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://sabbathgift.info/share/schools">via this link</a>.</p>
