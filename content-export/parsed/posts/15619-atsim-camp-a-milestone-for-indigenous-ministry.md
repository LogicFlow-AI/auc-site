<p>More than&nbsp;350 people from&nbsp;across Australia&nbsp;gathered at the national Indigenous camp, led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ministries (ATSIM)&nbsp;of the Australian Union Conference (AUC).&nbsp;Hosted at Watson Park in Brisbane, this was the first national&nbsp;camp&nbsp;since 2019, after delays caused by COVID-19 and the cancellation of the&nbsp;planned&nbsp;event last year in the aftermath of the cyclone and flooding in Cairns.</p>

<p>“Since our last camp, we have had some significant things happen, with the&nbsp;griefs and losses we have experienced&nbsp;in that time,&nbsp;including&nbsp;separation of&nbsp;families during COVID&nbsp;and then the referendum, so many&nbsp;of our&nbsp;people were keen to get together again&nbsp;for a time of healing and celebration,” said Pastor Darren&nbsp;Garlett, director of ATSIM.</p>

<p>Celebrating the theme of “Following Jesus: One Message, One Ministry, One Mob,” some camp participants travelled by bus for days from communities including Finke and Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory, as well as remote areas of South Australia, the Torres Strait, northern Queensland and Western Australia.</p>

<p>“Our people used to meet together for cultural events, which were times for sharing stories, sharing grieving, sharing good news and introducing new members of the family—and this camp is similar with the additional spiritual focus,” said Pastor John Beck, ATSIM’s senior pastor for Outback Remote Ministries. “For the next three years, our people are going to remember this camp, the stories shared, the songs we have sung. It is like a mini-evangelistic program where everybody is sharing together and encouraging one another.”A&nbsp;highlight of this year’s&nbsp;ATSIM camp was&nbsp;a Sabbath-afternoon&nbsp;baptism, after which a further seven people responded to an appeal to prepare for&nbsp;baptism. For ATSIM leaders Pastor&nbsp;Garlett&nbsp;and Pastor Luke Stuart—ATSIM director for South Queensland—the baptisms were personal, including&nbsp;Pastor&nbsp;Garlett’s&nbsp;grandson, Malcolm, and Pastor Stuart’s sons,&nbsp;Jacob, Nathanael and Joshua.&nbsp;“It is significant for four young men to be&nbsp;baptised&nbsp;and it is testament to Luke and his family that&nbsp;the&nbsp;three boys wanted to be baptised together,” Pastor&nbsp;Garlett reflected.</p>

<p>“ATSIM camps have always been a family camp with several generations together and the largest group&nbsp;being&nbsp;our younger people,” he added.&nbsp;“We are a very diverse&nbsp;and inclusivegroup, and that is something we are intentional about.”</p>

<p>AUC president Pastor Terry Johnson emphasised the importance of Indigenous ministry to the Australian church. “While Indigenous people make up about 3 per cent of the Australian population, they represent just under 6 per cent of our active Seventh-day Adventist members,” he said.&nbsp;“So&nbsp;this camp is&nbsp;an important gathering&nbsp;for our church, impacting a significant portion of our membership.”</p>

<p>As well as speaking at the ATSIM camp, Pastor Johnson said he has been impressed by Indigenous members’&nbsp;“sense of joy and resilience in the face of much attrition, particularly in the past two years.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I hear their individual stories, I’m constantly reminded of what they’ve&nbsp;experienced and&nbsp;survived,” he said. “It’s sobering, disquieting and yet encouraging as I hear time and again how God intervenes in their lives and brings them happiness.”</p>

<p>According to Pastor&nbsp;Garlett, the camp acts as a milestone and a time to reflect on the progress made and the work yet to be done&nbsp;in this unique ministry.&nbsp;“I think we can be&nbsp;proud of the fact that we have a strong ATSIM&nbsp;ministry&nbsp;and we&nbsp;have&nbsp;mechanisms in place to ensure that this will continue, with&nbsp;Mamarapha&nbsp;College and&nbsp;other&nbsp;key&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and supports,” he said.&nbsp;“But we also want to&nbsp;ensure that ATSIM is&nbsp;not&nbsp;creating&nbsp;a parallel church,&nbsp;that we&nbsp;have&nbsp;a growing presence&nbsp;and acceptance&nbsp;in the wider church.”</p>

<p>Initial planning has begun for the next ATSIM national camp&nbsp;in Perth, Western Australia, in&nbsp;January&nbsp;2028.</p>
