Flourish is a special event for Adventist Education Leaders. This conference is designed to equip and encourage you through thought provoking sessions, collaborative discussions, and spirit filled worship.

It is our prayer that you leave this conference refreshed, empowered, and ready to cultivate your learning environments where students and staff alike can flourish in Jesus, discover their God-given potential, and become a blessing to their communities.

May our time together deepen our shared vision and renew our passion for Christ and His mission through Adventist Education.
