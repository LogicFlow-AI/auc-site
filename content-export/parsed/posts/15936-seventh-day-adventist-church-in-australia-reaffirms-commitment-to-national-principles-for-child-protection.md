<p>The Australian Union of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (AUC) has reaffirmed its full commitment to the Australian National Principles for Child Safe Organisations, recognising the moral, ethical and biblical mandate to protect children and ensure the Church is a safe, thriving community for all.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to church leaders, the AUC remains focused on protecting the dignity and wellbeing of every child and vulnerable adult—a commitment “grounded in the sacred calling of Micah 6:8”. It is not only a legal or organisational duty, “it reflects God’s heart for justice, compassion and humble leadership”.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We cannot claim to walk with God while turning a blind eye to harm,” said AUC president Pastor Terry Johnson. “Our children deserve a church where safety is not negotiable, where leaders are accountable and where abuse has no place.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia aims to foster child safety by promoting transparent governance, risk management, education, and the empowerment of children and families, following the 10 national principles. According to church leaders, “While the Church has been vigilant on this issue since 2000, this marks a clear step forward in creating a church community where all are safe, heard and valued.”</p>

<p>“This is not a box-ticking exercise. It is a spiritual and moral imperative,” Pastor Johnson said. “Our faith calls us not only to believe but to act—to create communities where children can flourish without fear.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We believe in a thriving church where every child is protected, every voice is heard and every leader is accountable,” said Adsafe general manager Pastor Michael Worker. “Now is the time to stand together. For justice. For mercy. For our children.”&nbsp;</p>
