<p class="stk-block-text__text has-text-align-left">Greetings and welcome to the website for the 62<sup>nd </sup>General Conference (GC) Session, to be held in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A., from July 3-12, 2025.</p>

</div>
<div class="wp-block-stackable-text stk-block-text stk-block stk-763119f" data-block-id="763119f">
<p class="stk-block-text__text">In contrast to 61<sup>st</sup> GC Session held in 2022 for just 6 days in a hybrid setting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are delighted that the 62<sup>nd</sup> Session will return to a fully on-site event for a full 10 days. The Session will be open for all to attend, and everyone is encouraged to attend or to watch the live-streamed proceedings.</p>

<div class="wp-block-stackable-text stk-block-text stk-block stk-7998484" data-block-id="7998484">
<p class="stk-block-text__text">As a worldwide family, we come together during the Session not only to conduct business, but to be blessed by the wonderful fellowship of our brothers and sisters from around the globe. In addition to the regular business meetings, numerous ancillary meetings will be reintroduced, allowing all to enjoy a type of “camp meeting” experience with inspiring worship services during the week and on the weekends, training sessions, emphasis on our mission, musical performances, and special programs hosted by numerous ministries. In addition, the live exhibit hall will return, where visitors will enjoy learning more about their favorite ministries and organizations while discovering new resources and information from around the world.</p>

<p class="stk-block-text__text">The theme for the Session, “Jesus is Coming, I Will Go!” reminds us of our wonderful hope in the soon coming of our Savior and the importance of answering God’s call to go wherever He may lead to reach the world for Him. God has given Seventh-day Adventists a special message to share with the world, found in the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-12 and the fourth angel of Revelation 18:1-4. These messages are surely more relevant now than ever before in the history of the earth, and God invites each one of us to be a part of His last-day proclamation.</p>

<div class="wp-block-stackable-text stk-block-text stk-block stk-5e6aa1f" data-block-id="5e6aa1f">
<p class="stk-block-text__text">While there are many aspects of a General Conference Session, it is primarily a spiritual and business meeting of the world Church. During the meetings, world leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church are elected, and worldwide items are decided, such as fundamental beliefs, as well as constitutional and church manual items.</p>

</div>
<div class="wp-block-stackable-text stk-block-text stk-block stk-d4dfb08" data-block-id="d4dfb08">
<p class="stk-block-text__text">As we look forward to the 62<sup>nd</sup> General Conference Session, let’s pray together for God’s leading in a marvelous way as we plead for the outpouring of the latter rain of the Holy Spirit in anticipation of the soon second coming of Jesus Christ. We can be assured that “We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history” (<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, vol. 9, p. 10).</p>

</div>
<div class="wp-block-stackable-text stk-block-text stk-block stk-fec69e9" data-block-id="fec69e9">
<p class="stk-block-text__text">Let’s continue moving forward together, focusing on God’s Holy Word, on the Holy Spirit’s wonderful work of personal and corporate revival and reformation, and on Global Total Member Involvement saying, “Yes, Lord, I WILL Go,” helping to reach millions of people around the globe with the hope of Christ’s soon return!</p>

General Conference Session is a global spiritual gathering and a constitutionally required business meeting that has been held every five years since 1970. Its purpose is to vote on global leadership, set the direction of the Church for the next five years, and vote changes to the Constitution, Fundamental Beliefs and Church Manual.

GC Session is an open meeting—anyone can attend—but only delegates and invitees have the ability to speak and only delegates may vote. For this 62nd GC Session, 2,818 voting delegates are expected to attend. Each union nominates delegates to represent its field. In addition, delegates representing major church institutions are selected.
<h3 id="3-How-can-members-benefit-from-attending-the-Session" class="wp-block-heading">HOW CAN MEMBERS BENEFIT FROM ATTENDING THE SESSION?</h3>
Attendees gain an understanding of the world church and how it operates. They will literally see people from more countries and language groups than any other meetings in the Church and possibly in the world. World church members that are not able to attend in person are encouraged to participate online as all the meetings will be livestreamed.

For those working behind the scenes, the day starts with a Steering Committee to determine the agenda items for the day. The first public meeting is morning worship, followed by a business session that lasts until lunch. There is another business session in the afternoon. In the evenings, world regions have a chance to showcase mission, challenges, and opportunities, all presented with the color and flair of national dress and music.

A nominating committee is formed to nominate General Conference officers, departmental directors and associate directors, and division officers. The president is elected first and joins the Nominating Committee to offer recommendations on all the other nominations, which the committee may choose to accept or reject.
