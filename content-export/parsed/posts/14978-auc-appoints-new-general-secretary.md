<p>Pastor Masengi comes with a diverse range of experience, graduating with a Bachelor of Accounting from Universitas Advent Indonesia and an MBA from Saint Thomas University. He worked for US oil and gas corporation ConocoPhillips for 23 years in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia as the finance manager, planning manager and finance director. He went on to complete a Masters of Divinity and was called to the South Queensland Conference as an intern minister and the Northern Australian Conference (NAC) as general secretary and chief financial officer.

<p>AUC president Pastor Terry Johnson said, “We want to thank Pastor Worker for his seven years of service at the Union, with a combined 19 years of service in conference and union leadership. His pastoral care and understanding was significant, as decisions that were made always took into consideration the spiritual impact. His recall of policy, constitutions, process and procedure is second to none and he will be sorely missed by our entire team.&nbsp;We wish him well and look forward to future collaboration.”</p>

<p>Pastor Johnson described Pastor Masengi as a skilled administrator with evident high capacity. “He’s competent, calm and a quietly spoken man who will bring a wealth of corporate knowledge along with his spiritual shepherding, leadership and administration gifts to the role here at the Union,” he said.&nbsp;“He has done well in the NAC and the members have loved his missional focus, clarity in communication and warm personality. We believe he will continue the legacy of godly secretaries that the AUC has had since its inception in 2001 with Mr Kingsley Wood, Pastor Ken Vogel and Pastor Michael Worker.”</p>
