<p>Secondary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students around Australia were given the opportunity to design and submit artwork and a supporting story that would represent ASA’s vision for reconciliation, which is for everyone to walk together for mutual liberation and also align with ASA’s Christian beliefs.</p>

<p>“We were very pleased with the artwork submitted,” stated Dr. Daryl Murdoch, national director of ASA, “Shakana’s artwork really captured the essence of reconciliation, not just between us and our First Nations peoples, but between all humans and God.”</p>
