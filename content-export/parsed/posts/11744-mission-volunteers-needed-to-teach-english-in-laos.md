<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia (AUC) needs volunteers for an 18-month mission service opportunity in Laos. Two positions exist to teach English and life skills at Namtipsavan Bilingual School in XiangKhouang.</p>

<p>Namtipsavan School is currently a kindergarten, primary school—up to grade 3—and an English language centre. The school has a continuous growth plan to add one grade each year to Year 12. With a newly constructed primary school, the building of the secondary school is expected to commence soon.</p>

<p>Offering subjects such as music, arts, business, and IT, Namtipsavan School places emphasis on teaching students more than just what is in the curriculum. Students also learn life skills and the importance of being responsible and developing good character.</p>

<p>In a predominantly Buddhist country, Adventist Education has been instrumental in reaching into the community. AUC secretary Pastor Michael Worker, said, “The mission needs in Laos and Thailand are vast and the Church in Australia is excited to partner with these countries to create opportunities for those interested in short- and long-term mission service.”</p>
