<p>“She is a visionary, mentor and servant of Christ,” he said. “Her leadership has never been about titles or positions, but about people—about students, teachers, leaders, families and the communities who make up the living heart of Adventist education across Australia.</p>

<p>“Her words were grounded in wisdom, faith and deep care. She reminded us that education is not just about curriculum or compliance, but about shaping lives for eternity. Her passion has always been to ensure that our schools are places where young people encounter Jesus, experience belonging and flourish as whole people.”</p>
