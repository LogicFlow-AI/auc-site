<p>More than 250 young people gathered at Avondale University on October 11 for a night of praise and testimony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event was hosted by the Australian Union Conference (AUC) youth department’s official publication&nbsp;<em>My Edge&nbsp;</em>magazine in collaboration with SALT—a Friday night program run by and for Avondale students.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program featured young adult speakers Tia Abel and Ella Meleisea who shared their testimonies, highlighting how God has worked in their lives.</p>

<p>Another feature was the music by Gilson College Community Church (GCC) and the special items performed by Joshua Key and Abigail Onsoe.</p>

<p>For attendee Sarah Tucker from Avondale University Seventh-day Adventist Church, the highlight of the night was “the praise and worship brought to us by GCC—they were incredible and inspiring”.</p>

<p>Social media coordinator for&nbsp;<em>My Edge&nbsp;</em>magazine<em>&nbsp;</em>Kapungwe Besa shared, “Praise and testimony night began as a small vision, a way to share young people’s stories of God’s work in their lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Despite initial challenges, the overwhelming turnout and requests to bring it interstate affirmed my belief in the power of personal testimonies. Being at Avondale reminded me that this vision is driven not by my strength, but by God’s purpose.”</p>

<p>This was Ms Besa’s last event with&nbsp;<em>My Edge</em>&nbsp;as she plans to step away from the role later this year.</p>
