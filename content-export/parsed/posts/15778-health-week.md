The theme “Breaking Chains” highlights the reality that addiction goes beyond drugs or alcohol. “When we hear the word ‘addictions’ we often think in terms of drugs or alcohol, but there are many other types of addiction that fall under a category of behavioural addictions,” said Pamela Townend, South Pacific Division health coordinator. “Examples of this are food, exercise, work and shopping, to name just a few.”
