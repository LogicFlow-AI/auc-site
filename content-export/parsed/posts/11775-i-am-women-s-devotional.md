<p>The Australian Union Conference (AUC) launched the I AM women’s devotional at the AUC Executive Committee on May 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inspired by the I AM affirmation cards which include inspiring statements such as I AM Brave, I AM Loved, and I AM Powerful, the devotional is set to challenge how women see themselves and encourage them to recognise what they could be when they allow God to transform them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>26 women from around Australia wrote a devotional for each of these statements, and each devotional is accompanied by a set of thought-provoking questions to help readers reflect on scripture and ultimately reflect on the I AM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wanted to gather a collection of stories from real women around Australia,” explained Pastor Sylvia Mendez, women’s ministries and family ministries director at the AUC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are mums, wives, daughters, and sisters. Some are teachers, some work in admin and some are pastors, there are a wide variety of women from various ages and at different stages of their lives.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The honest and open devotionals will allow readers to see how God has led the writers through difficult times and how they have felt each of these inspiring statements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These devotionals allow readers to understand who God is through these statements and who we are through these statements,” added Pastor Mendez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Can I say that I AM Patient? I AM Beautiful? I am Powerful? and actually believe it? This devotional takes the reader on a deeper journey to realise that although we may not always feel these things, when we lean into God, we can become these things.”</p>
