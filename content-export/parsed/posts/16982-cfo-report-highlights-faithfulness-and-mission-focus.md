<p>In his final report as CFO before retirement, Peter Cameron presented a positive picture of the financial health of the Australian Union Conference (AUC) of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>

<p>Addressing delegates on the second day of the&nbsp;<a href="https://record.adventistchurch.com/2025/09/01/auc-constituency-meeting-begins-with-praise-and-prayer/">AUC constituency meeting</a>, Mr Cameron began by reporting on the entity that holds the land and buildings for the organisation, known as the Australian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (AUU). While there has been significant building work undertaken during the 2020-2025 quinquennium, the entity is in a positive financial position. The largest project was the construction of new facilities at Mamarapha College (Western Australia), including new learning areas, a computer lab and meeting space. The $2 million investment also included extensions to the administration block.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron also reported on the Seventh-day Adventist Church (Australian Union Conference) Trust, which is the operating entity of the AUC. Over the quinquennium, tithe increased by 16.47 per cent, from $89.8 million to $104.6 million.</p>

<p>“I just want to thank the faithful members of the churches in Australia,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reflecting on 24 years of tithe records, he noted that only three years saw a decline from the previous year—and in each case the drop was less than 1 per cent. “God works in amazing ways and He continues to bless the work of the Union for His purposes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m so thankful that we have excellent people in our conferences and in our churches who see the benefit of contributing to the work of the Church and seeing it grow. That’s the key.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Cameron highlighted that the Union has continued to support Global Mission partners through the offerings received. Its partnership with the Southeast Asia Union Mission has included sponsorship of eight students at Asia-Pacific International University and construction of a village church. In partnership with the South Pacific Division, the Union is also involved in the construction of the Western Border Training School. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“We may not impact on everybody, but we can impact on many,” he said. “Mission is one of the most important things that we can do in our organisation. If we do not reach out, we are failing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He pointed to the AUC’s strategic focus, emphasising that mission and discipleship remain central to its work. “The passion of our Church is not the money that we collect and the way that we operate. The passion of our Church is how we can use those funds.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Church growth is the goal: “Growth, and the people who come with that growth, is what’s going to drive this organisation . . . it’s going to be bringing people who have no concept of Jesus to understand Jesus. If we do nothing, our Church will die.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Cameron’s many years of service was affirmed by delegates, including South Queensland Conference CFO Scott Hopkins, who said, “It’s a tough gig being the CFO sometimes and one of the few people who can understand what we are going through on a daily basis has been Peter . . . I do want to sincerely thank you for your ministry.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greater Sydney Conference delegate David Swain moved a motion of appreciation: “that this meeting expresses its deepest appreciation for Peter for his service and his work as CFO”, which was wholeheartedly supported by delegates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After serving the Church in financial roles for more than 40 years, Mr Cameron will now step down, with&nbsp;<a href="https://record.adventistchurch.com/2025/09/01/new-cfo-eager-to-drive-strategy/">Graeme Drinkall appointed as the new CFO.</a></p>
