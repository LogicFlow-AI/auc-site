<p>The youth ministries department of the Australian Union Conference (AUC) has begun rolling out their new STORMCo shirts for 2024 which feature Indigenous artwork by artist Susan Doolan.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Service To Others Really Matters (STORMCo) is an initiative that allows youth and young adults to visit communities and serve others, with the goal of presenting Christian faith in action by building long-term relationships.</p>

<p>Ms Doolan described the meaning behind her artwork: “[The] circles represent gathering places, [the] cross represents Jesus, the Bible is there because they teach the youth from the Bible, colours represent the land, footprints are the leaders walking to the gathering place.</p>

<p>“These are the different age groups coming together and learning about Jesus.”</p>

<p>This year, the AUC has produced 1877 shirts for teams across Australia to wear while serving the community.</p>

<p>AUC youth ministries director Pastor Jeffrey Parker said, “I am so proud of all our STORMCo teams. Each team member volunteers at least a week of their time to reach into a community outside of their own.</p>

<p>“The impact of STORMCo is beyond measure. This seed-planting evangelism that is done by our youth and young adults reaches deep into communities that are hard to reach any other way. The youth departments across Australia praise Jesus for our committed youth and young adults who go forward in His name.”</p>
