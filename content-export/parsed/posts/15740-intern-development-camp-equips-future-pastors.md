<p>Organised annually by the AUC, the camp provides intensive training to help equip future pastors for practical ministry. Interns participate in real-life scenarios, panel discussions and small group sessions, with opportunities to ask candid questions and reflect on their calling.</p>

<p>“Interns Development Camp is always a highlight on the calendar,” said AUC ministerial secretary Pastor Lyndelle Peterson. “It’s an important time of equipping, empowering and supporting our new ministers. We address the challenges and celebrate the joys of ministry in a prayerful and supportive environment. The enthusiasm and passion our interns bring to ministry is infectious, and our team leaves feeling inspired as well.”</p>
