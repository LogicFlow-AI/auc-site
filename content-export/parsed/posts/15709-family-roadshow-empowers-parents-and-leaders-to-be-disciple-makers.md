<p>Children and family ministry leaders, parents, carers and teachers from across Australia gathered during a two-week roadshow from January 31 to February 16.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roadshow was a collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://record.adventistchurch.com/2024/06/14/the-worship-project/">The Worship Project</a>, an Australian Union Conference (AUC) run initiative that inspires individuals and families to get involved in daily worship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Special guest speaker Rachel Turner travelled across seven conferences, visiting 15 locations including schools, to speak about topics such as household worship and empowering parents to be disciple-makers at home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Turner is the discipleship pastor at Hope Church Harrogate in the United Kingdom, and the founder of Parenting for Faith. She is the author of 10 books for families, parents and church leaders, including&nbsp;<em>Parenting as a Church Leader</em>,&nbsp;<em>Comfort in Uncertain Times</em>,&nbsp;<em>It Takes a Church to Raise a Parent</em>&nbsp;and her new release&nbsp;<em>Parenting Teens for a Life of Faith</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AUC women’s ministries and resource development director Pastor Sylvia Mendez said, “Rachel is a dynamic speaker and communicator who empowered parents to recognise they are best placed to help their children become God connected just by modelling their personal faith walk with God authentically. We are so glad that we could bring Rachel to Australia as part of The Worship Project, an initiative to inspire daily worship. “</p>

<p>A parent who was at one of the events commented, “I can see why you guys brought [Rachel] over. What great presentations and very relevant to me and my family. I loved it and I will work on implementing the five tools with my family. She was great.”</p>

<p>WA Conference discipleship ministries team leader Jody Eddy said, “Guiding kids into a deep and loving connection with God is something many parents long to do. I valued what Rachel shared as it was inspiring but also incredibly practical. Other parents shared with me how they felt empowered to share their faith with their kids in ways they had&nbsp;never thought of before.”</p>
