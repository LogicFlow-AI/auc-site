<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia has formally requested a review of the General Conference’s official statement on immunisation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a></a>In response to this request, the Executive Committee of the Australian Union Conference (AUC) carefully considered the matter during its recent meetings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The committee dedicated significant time to prayerfully reflecting on the implications of the <a href="https://gc.adventist.org/official-statements/immunization/">2015 and 2021 immunisation statements</a>—particularly regarding the reference to “peer-reviewed science” alongside the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy. Concerns were raised about the potential unintended consequences of this wording for the Church’s theological clarity and authority structure.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following respectful and thoughtful discussion, the Executive Committee voted to send a letter to the leadership of the General Conference. This letter outlines the committee’s concerns and formally requests a review of both the current immunisation statement and the processes used in its development.</p>

<p>“The Executive Committee recognised the importance of supporting public health while also ensuring that the distinct authority of Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy is upheld within our Church,” said Pastor Terry Johnson, AUC president. “We remain committed to ongoing, constructive dialogue with the General Conference on this important issue.”</p>

<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia reaffirms its commitment to promoting the wellbeing of its members and the wider community. It looks forward to continued conversations that honour both the Church’s health principles and its theological foundations.</p>
