Many people are deeply troubled by: Inflation, The Ukraine war; the fallout of COVID-19; political, social &amp; economic upheaval and uncertainty; international tensions &amp; conflicts; terrorism; climate change; and the rapid pace at which AI and technology continue to expand. All of this is creating feelings of anxiety about the future, which makes it reasonable to wonder, “What does the future hold?” This series invites you to take the journey of a lifetime, in which you will travel to lost civilisations to understand the significance of current global events, which will inevitably shape how the future unfolds. The Faith Experiment looks at irrefutable evidence from history, archaeology and ancient manuscripts.
