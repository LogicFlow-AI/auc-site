<p>Lead pastor at Gilson College Community Church Dr Mau Tuaoi, spoke on the theme Me3 (Me To The Power Of Three). Dr Tuaoi reminded all in attendance what ministry can look like when they deliberately partner with God and He “unleashes His power within them”. Dr Tuaoi also highlighted that school chaplains have a unique opportunity to “build the kingdom of grace and glory in the lives of those in the three areas of college, church and community”.</p>

<p>French Polynesia Mission women’s ministry leader Danièle Maheahea, who attended the event, said, “The Chaplains Convention has made me realise that chaplaincy in our schools, churches and communities is a blessing from God. When God chooses a person, He equips them, builds them up, supports them and provides a place where they can belong to Him and for Him.”</p>
