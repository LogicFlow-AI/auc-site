<p>“This rebranded website encapsulates the new discipleship focus on the cycle of evangelism—a continuous journey of connecting, growing, serving and multiplying,” said Pastor Dumbrava.</p>

<p>Described as more than a website, <a href="https://disciple.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disciple.org.au</a> is intended to serve as a central hub for church leaders, pastors and members seeking practical resources for Bible studies, small group leadership and local mission.</p>

<p>Melbourne City Asian church pastor Jinha Kim praised the site’s accessibility. “My favourite resource to go to is&nbsp;disciple.org.au because there are resources on how to give a Bible study, how to lead small groups, what the offering schedule is and many different ways to connect with people in your community,” she said.</p>
