<p>“As Adventists, we&nbsp;are called&nbsp;to speak up for the voiceless and protect those who are vulnerable,” said Sylvia Mendez, director of women’s ministries in Australia. “EnditNow is more than an annual event—it’s a movement.&nbsp;We’re calling on every local church to join us in creating safe spaces, both&nbsp;within and beyond our walls.”</p>
