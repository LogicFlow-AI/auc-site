The Australian Union Conference (AUC) has established a Women in Pastoral Ministry (WiPM) Scholarship Fund which seeks to provide financial assistance to female ministry and theology students enrolled at Avondale University &amp; Mamarapha College. The scholarship has been established to affirm and encourage women to undertake theological training allowing them to be equipped for pastoral ministry in the local church.

A limited number of scholarships are available for up to 4 years of full-time equivalent study for the Bachelor of Ministry and Theology Degree (BMinTh), up to 4 years of study for the Advanced Diploma of Indigenous Pastoral Ministry (AdvDipIPM) and up to 2 years of full-time equivalent study for the Master of Ministry and Theology (MMin) students. Applications can be made at any stage of their studies at Avondale University or Mamarapha College, however, scholarships will not be retrospectively applied to completed units. There will be a pro-rata reduction in funding if the student enrols in less than a full-time program of study. Successful applicants will be paired with a mentor who will meet with them (Via Zoom and/or in person) at least twice per year to support and encourage them in their preparation for pastoral ministry. We encourage applicants who meet the criteria below to complete the attached form.

The value of each scholarship is worth up to $14,000* for BMinTh, $7,000* for the MMIn and $4,000 for AdvDipIPM (as reviewed from time to time).

<em>*If successful, AUC WIPM Scholarship recipients enrolled at Avondale University will receive funding from the SPD WIM Scholarship to top up the scholarship to the percentage stated above. This may be reviewed annually.</em>

Applications close February 21, 2024.
