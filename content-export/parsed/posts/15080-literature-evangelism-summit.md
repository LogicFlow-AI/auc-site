Come together with Literature Evangelists and friends from Australia and New Zealand, for five days of spiritual growth, skill-sharing and ministry-enriching fellowship. Existing Literature Evangelists, others just getting started in literature ministry, and others sensing God’s prompting to learn to share literature, will come together in this relaxing country setting. Enjoy a day at Signs Publishing in Warburton, and a Sabbath morning in Warburton and later in Nunawading. This time together will empower you to share hope through literature in your community.
