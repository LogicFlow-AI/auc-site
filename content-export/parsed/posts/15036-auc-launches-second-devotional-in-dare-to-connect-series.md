<p>The Australian Union Conference (AUC) personal ministries department launched a new book as part of the Dare to Connect series during the executive meetings on May 29.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Dare to Connect with Others </em>is the second book in the <em>Dare to Connect</em> series compiled by personal ministries director Pastor Nicu Dumbrava. This book can be used as a personal study journal, small group resource or discussion guide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book is a series of articles about connecting with others from different backgrounds and faith traditions written by various people from across Australia. Each article ends with a series of questions that encourage the reader to reflect on how they can connect with those around them.</p>

<p>Personal Ministries Director Pastor Nicu Dumbrava said, “In this current post-Christian, post-modern age, the methods of evangelism must adapt and change so that we can see a true renewal of the Advent movement in Australia.” He continued, “If we want to be effective in proclaiming the gospel in the context of the 3 angels’ messages in Australia, we need to be able to connect or reconnect, with people the way Jesus did.”</p>

<p>“Jesus never spoke to two people the same way, and neither should we,” Pastor Dumbrava added.</p>
