<p>AUC youth director pastor Jeffrey Parker said, “it is very exciting to see&nbsp;<em>My Edge</em>&nbsp;going from strength to strength.&nbsp;<em>My Edge</em>&nbsp;has been part of the Adventist youth ministry for 25 years this summer.”</p>

<p>Social media coordinator for&nbsp;<em>My Edge</em>&nbsp;magazine Kapungwe Besa said, “the whole event was a big highlight and blessing for me. From the worship team who only practised once together before the event, to the testimonies, to the number of young adults in the room praising together.”</p>

<p>According to Ms Besa, the outcome of the night surpassed the team’s expectations, “it was definitely all God. But the biggest blessing for me was when the program was finished, people came up to me and asked, ‘when’s the next one?’. We still don’t know the answer to that question, but hopefully soon,” she said.</p>
