<p>“The testimonies that were shared resonated with all of us, as we all face similar battles with our faith,” said attendee Jazmin Gonzalez from Gold Coast Central Seventh-day Adventist Church. “Hearing how God moved in [the speakers’] lives was so inspiring and uplifting. What an amazing night. We can’t wait for the next one!”</p>
