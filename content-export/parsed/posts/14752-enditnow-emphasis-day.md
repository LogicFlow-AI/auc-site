<div dir="auto">Join us on Friday August 23rd at 7:30pm (AEST) for the 2024 livestreamed National enditnow online summit. This year our theme is "Understanding Trauma and how the Church can respond." Our keynote speaker Dr Torben Berglund will unpack trauma for us. This will be followed by a live panel that will discuss how the church can respond to those experiencing trauma. Our viewers will be able to send in questions live and have the panel respond. On standby we will have a psychologist for anyone needing immediate support.</div>
