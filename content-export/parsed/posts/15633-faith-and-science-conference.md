<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The universe has fascinated people for centuries—it’s beautiful galaxies, nebulae and our very own solar system.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">What is the Biblical perspective of how the universe came into being and the dynamics of its large space-time structure? Does quantum physics provide an openness in the natural world for God to perform supernatural miracles? Also, is there any Biblical or empirical evidence that life exists anywhere else in the universe?</p>

Don’t miss out on the amazing astronomy field trip to the Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium—there are only a<strong> limited number of places available</strong>, so register now so that you are not disappointed!</p>
