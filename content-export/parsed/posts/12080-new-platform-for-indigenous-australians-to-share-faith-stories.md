<p>Students and staff at Mamarapha College in Western Australia will now have their stories shared across the nation, courtesy of a new radio studio on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opened in May, the studio was built by Mamarapha students and Faith FM producer Bradley Martin, with the opening ceremony attended by members of the Australian Union Conference (AUC) board. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are thrilled to be able to assist Mamarapha in the production of this studio,” said AUC president Pastor Terry Johnson. “With the tools and partnership with Faith FM at their disposal, we are excited to see them create and share their stories to further the gospel.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the past few months, Mamarapha students have worked on creating and broadcasting a new program, called&nbsp;<em>Australian Stories</em>. Airing once a week, the show aims to share the various stories from Indigenous&nbsp;people&nbsp;all over Australia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This [station] is about training and equipping our students to be confident Christian leaders in their own communities, sharing stories about themselves, and stories that their communities can truly connect with on a deep and personal level,” said outgoing Mamarapha College principal Pastor David Garrard. </p>

<p>The radio studio is an ongoing collaborative effort with Faith FM, who will support Mamarapha students via video resources and training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Australia is a multicultural country, and so being able to support Mamarapha and help amplify their unique voice across Australia has been a major milestone for Faith FM,” said national content and promotions manager Pastor Robbie Berghan. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of the benefits of this studio is it will allow all types of Australians to share their stories in their own languages,” said Pastor Darren Garlett, director of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ministries (ATSIM) at the AUC. “This will help accelerate ATSIM work in parts of Australia that not many churches can reach.”&nbsp;</p>
