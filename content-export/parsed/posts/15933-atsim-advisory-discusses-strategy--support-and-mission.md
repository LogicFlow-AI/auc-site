<p>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ministries (ATSIM) department of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia (AUC), spent time in strategy, professional development and empowering young leaders in Melbourne, Victoria, from May 22 to 27.</p>

<p>Billed as the ATSIM Workers Personal Development Training and Indigenous Advisory, the advisory saw 24 individuals from across Australia, including Indigenous, invited young people and those who work for ATSIM in various capacities, come together to assist Church with its mission of making disciples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meetings started on Thursday where conference ATSIM directors and Indigenous pastors engaged in leadership training. The ATSIM leaders were motivated by speakers such as Aboriginal pastor and advocate of climate and social justice, Pastor Raymond Minniecon, relationship and storytelling coordinator at Common Grace, Safina Stewart, and First Nations theologian, Professor Anne Pattel-Gray.</p>

<p>Pastor Minniecon spoke to the leaders about preserving their wellbeing and encouraged them to hold their place in a changing society. Understanding the struggle that Indigenous people face, he suggested that they should be striving for restoration—to rebuild and renew their people.</p>

<p>“We face huge barriers as First Nations peoples,” stated Pastor Minniecon, “I am always encouraged by meeting fellow Christian Indigenous travellers on the same road together.”</p>

<p>Ms Stewart gave the team ideas on how to share God by using their personal stories and items that can be found in nature to better engage those they are speaking with, while Professor Pattel-Gray shared about her work of forming Indigenous theology and challenged the team to read Scripture and look for connections to their culture, which will enhance their methods of conveying the gospel to their churches. She also challenged the churches to do better in their interaction with Indigenous people and that the teachings of Jesus need to be lived out for reconciliation to be effective.</p>

<p>Pastor Darren Garlett, AUC ATSIM director, explained why these meetings were important: “AUC ATSIM is committed to mission—involving the ATSIM leaders in personal development workshops helps to sharpen their skills to being effective at connecting relationships for Jesus.”</p>

<p>The group attended Crosswalk Seventh-day Adventist church on Sabbath, where they were able to share with church members there about the Indigenous work that is happening around Australia and Mamarapha College.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a group of young Indigenous people, joined the meetings to discuss ATSIM Strategy for the next quinquennium. This was a chance to consult with Indigenous youth and the Seventh-day Adventist Church on how the church can better serve the Indigenous community in the next five years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Having a group of ATSIM youth join the advisory was welcomed,” stated Pastor Garlett, “The freshness of their ideas and passion really excited the ATSIM team about our future plans for ATSIM.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I found the meetings incredibly uplifting and meaningful,” said Babetha Nawia, one of the youth from Kubin, Moa Island in the Torres Strait. “It’s so powerful to gather with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who both share faith in God and Culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I gained a deeper understanding of how committed ATSIM is to creating a space where culture and faith can thrive together. It’s exciting to see the ministry support local leaders and encourage our people to have a voice not only in church but in life.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia is looking forward to implementing some of the ideas into the AUC ATSIM Strategic Plan during the next five years of ministry—growing the church within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>
