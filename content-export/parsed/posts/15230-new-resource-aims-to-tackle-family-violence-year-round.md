<p>Women and&nbsp;family&nbsp;ministries director pastor Sylvia Mendez explained the importance of continuing the discussion.&nbsp;“It is important that we move beyond an&nbsp;enditnow&nbsp;emphasis day where we highlight this issue once a year and instead work together to raise awareness, provide training and support the whole year round,”&nbsp;she said.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Violence&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;only happen once a year&nbsp;and&nbsp;if we only discuss it once a year, we are failing at truly making a difference through the enditnow initiative,”&nbsp;added Pastor Mendez.</p>
