<strong>The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is celebrating its 40th anniversary in Australia in 2024.</strong>

ADRA is the global humanitarian arm of the Seventh-day Adventist Church that serves communities regardless of ethnicity, political party, or religious affiliation.  The international non-profit agency works with communities, organisations, and governments to enhance the lives of millions of people via sustainable community development and disaster relief.
<blockquote>“Our 40th anniversary is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our staff members and partners, who have worked relentlessly to provide healing and hope to people in need.  ADRA has made significant progress in its four decades of existence, nevertheless, more work remains.  As we commemorate this milestone, we also look forward to the future and the opportunities to continue making a remarkable difference in underprivileged communities,” says Michael Kruger, president of ADRA International. “ADRA is grateful for the support of donors, volunteers, partners, and the Adventist Church, which make it possible for us to positively impact the lives of the millions of people we serve. We remain committed to our mission of serving humanity so that all people may live as God intended.”</blockquote>
<strong>Join us for a full day of celebrations on October 26 to mark our 40 year anniversary.</strong>
