<h1 class="wp-block-heading">#weRtheCHURCH 2024 celebrates God’s goodness</h1>
This year #weRtheCHURCH is all about celebrating God’s goodness—and there’s plenty of things to celebrate!

On August 2, viewers will be transported to the beautiful campus of Pacific Adventist University (PAU) for a program that showcases the goodness of God right across the South Pacific.

“It seems fitting to host this year’s program at PAU as it celebrates a special anniversary in 2024 — 40 years of God’s blessings as a growing and thriving Adventist institution,” said South Pacific Division (SPD) communication director Tracey Bridcutt.

“PAU is just one of the many good stories in this year’s #weRtheCHURCH program. We have inspiring news and testimonies to share from right across the SPD—from Australia to Tuvalu, New Zealand to Cook Islands, Tonga to New Caledonia.”

Music is always a popular part of #weRtheCHURCH and this year’s program will be no exception, according to Mrs Bridcutt. “The PAU choir with their amazing harmonies will be performing several songs—their music will be a real highlight,” she said.

“It’s going to be an uplifting program full of good news stories—you won’t want to miss it!”

The inspiration for this year’s program comes from the 2024 theme of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission: “I Will Go and Celebrate His Goodness”.

Now in its fourth year, #weRtheCHURCH continues to unite the SPD church family for a time of worship and prayer, inspirational stories and special music. The program will be hosted by SPD president Pastor Glenn Townend and PAU students Mele Kauvaka and Gary Iga.

Due to the various time zones across the South Pacific, the program will be screened twice: at 5pm and 7pm (AEST). Before each program, an episode of The Rescue children’s show will be screened. At 8:30pm everyone is invited to join a half-hour “Prayer with the President” live Zoom session, hosted by Pastor Townend. Captions will be available in English and French.
