We are excited to share with you the ATSIM National Camp will be 15-19 January, 2025 in Brisbane Qld. After being postponed due to Cyclone Jasper in December 2023 it was decided to seek an alternative venue in south Queensland. Watson Park Convention Centre is well know to our campers and we look forward to working with them to host an amazing event that brings Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people together to celebrate and worship.  ATSIM Camp is coming in 2025 and registrations are now open! Camp will be held from 15-19 January 2025 at Watson Park Convention Centre, Dakabin QLD.
