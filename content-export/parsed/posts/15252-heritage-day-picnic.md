<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Heritage Day Picnic</h2>
Join us at Sunnyside on Saturday afternoon, October 12 for our heritage day picnic. Bring your picnic baskets and your best 1800s costumes and bask on the lawns before taking a tour of the historic home of Sunnyside. “The Narrow Way” will be screening in the hall.

If you can’t make it to Sunnyside, we invite you to run a heritage picnic on your own church lawns to celebrate heritage month.
