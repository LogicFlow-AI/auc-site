<strong>end<span class="enditnow">it</span>now</strong>® is a global initiative to raise awareness and advocate for the end of violence around the world.

It aims to mobilise Seventh-day Adventists around the world and invites other community groups to join in to resolve this worldwide issue.

This initiative, which extends to more than 200 countries and territories, was launched in October 2009 in partnership between the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA)–a prominent humanitarian organisation and the Department of Women’s Ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, two entities that are representative of the Adventist Church.

<strong>enditnow is the most important stand</strong> the Seventh-day Adventist Church has ever taken regarding violence against women, men and children.
