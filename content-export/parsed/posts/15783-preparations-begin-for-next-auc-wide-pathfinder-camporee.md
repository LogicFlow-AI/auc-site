<p>Hosted by the AUC youth ministries department, the event—held every four years—will bring together Pathfinders from across Australia for a week of worship, outdoor activities and fellowship. The theme, <em>“Trusted,”</em> will focus on a biblical figure from the Old Testament, with more details to be revealed closer to the event.</p>

<p>AUC youth director Pastor Jeffrey Parker highlighted the importance of the event for young people. “Pathfinder Camporees are amazing memory events for our Church’s 10–16-year-olds,” he said. “Many hundreds of decisions to follow Jesus and&nbsp;be baptised&nbsp;are made at Camporees.”</p>

<p>Pastor Parker also highlighted the importance of Pathfinders in local churches. “Pathfinders continue to grow across&nbsp;all of Australia, with 4392 Pathfinders registered in 2025. Pathfinder clubs and their intergenerational connections within the Church are so vital for the retention of our teens. The informal mentoring&nbsp;that happens&nbsp;in our 192 clubs is one of our Church’s best mentoring programs.”</p>
