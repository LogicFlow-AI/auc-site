Speakers at the ceremony encouraged graduates to embrace their calling and trust in God’s guidance. Pastor Brad Thomas, Western Australian Conference secretary, urged the students to allow God to use them in His work, while Pastor Ken Vogel, founder of Mamarapha College, reminded them in his graduation charge to worship, trust and serve God because “He is more than enough.”</p>
