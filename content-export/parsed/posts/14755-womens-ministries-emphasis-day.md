God sees us wandering in the “deserts” of our lives, in our pain of lost dreams and relationships, and in our shame when we have failed even ourselves. Nothing happens that God doesn’t notice. Our prayer is that you will see how closely God watches over you, that you will will pay attention to God at work in your life, and that you will keep your eyes focused on Him. The 2024 Women's Ministries Emphasis Day resource packet, <em>The God Who Sees You,</em> is written by Edith Ruiz-Espinoza, Inter-American Division Women's Ministries director.
