<p>The Australian Union Conference (AUC) Women’s Ministries department has launched&nbsp;<em>I AM Women’s Devotional Volume 2</em>, the second instalment in a devotional series created to support personal reflection and small group discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compiled by Pastor Sylvia Mendez, AUC Women’s Ministries and resource development director, the book features a collection of devotions by women of faith&nbsp;from&nbsp;across Australia and New Zealand. Each reflection explores an aspect of God’s character and ends with questions designed to encourage personal application.</p>

<p>A set of affirmation cards accompanies the book,&nbsp;with each card&nbsp;corresponding to one of the devotional’s I AM statements—such as I AM wanted, I&nbsp;AM healed&nbsp;and&nbsp;I AM Wonderful.</p>

<p>“As I visited events across Australia—from Big Camp to women’s retreats and Converge—I kept being asked when we were planning to release a second volume,” said Pastor Mendez.&nbsp;“It was these requests, from&nbsp;women both young and older, that inspired us to develop a new series of I AM statements and invite local women to once again write from their personal experiences.”</p>

<p>“It is my prayer that this resource will be a blessing to the many women—and even men, I’ve heard—who dive into these real stories of God’s anchoring love in the ups and downs of life,” she added.</p>
