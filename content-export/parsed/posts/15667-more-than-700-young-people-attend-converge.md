<p>A total of 732 young people from across Australia gathered at Converge—an annual Adventist youth conference held this year from February 7 to 10—to worship, connect and grow in their faith.</p>

<p>Held at Yarra Holiday Park (formerly Stuart’s Point Convention Centre) in NSW, the event included worship programs, presentations and water sports, as well as time to mingle and go to the beach.</p>

<p>Converge began nine years ago with the theme “hang out with Jesus and your mates”, designed for young people to connect with others, an aspect that Australian Union Conference youth director Pastor Jeff Parker said is just as important as the worship services. He explained that the event is also the place where young adults can lead. “You’ll notice it’s all been young adults up the front. We step back and want them to step up and lead their fellow young adults. That’s really what it’s all about.”</p>

<p>“Converge is a really powerful event to introduce Jesus to the 15-20 per cent of attendees we believe are not involved in church, but just attended with their friends,” added Pastor Parker.</p>

<p>Programs held morning and evening featured praise and worship and talks from the main speaker, Pastor Lachlan Campbell, from the South Queensland Conference. Pastor Campbell’s theme was discipleship and mission, as he explained, “what it means to follow Jesus and make followers”.</p>

<p>“There’s been a real call to action this year at Converge. Like, just go do something, whether it’s go serve, go to Converge, go to Avondale or go love your neighbours,” said Pastor Campbell.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As well as the main programs, Converge offered presentations on initiatives in which young people can get involved. These featured Catalyst, a 14-week experience held at Avondale University to equip young adults for discipleship, Adventist Volunteer Service and Red Frogs, an Australian Christian youth charity created to support schoolies on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>Attendees described the event as “enriching”. According to Avondale theology student Keanu Hodges, Converge was a place to “share in an experience of knowing Jesus more and learn different ways to live a life of a disciple."</p>
