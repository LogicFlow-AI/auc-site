<p>Mentor and Gilson College Community Church youth pastoral worker Zion Meleisea described the event as an unforgettable experience. “I had the privilege of mentoring 10 amazing 15- to 16-year-olds from Victoria, alongside my fellow mentor Tiarey Croft. The spiritual growth, the connections, and the energy of the event were incredibly impactful. It was so encouraging to see the grassroots of our Church vibrant, passionate and full of potential. The future is looking bright!”</p>
