For years Adventurers and Adventurer leaders have been waiting for a special world event to celebrate what it means to be an Adventurer. We are proud and excited to announce that we now have a World Adventurer Day! This event will take place every third Sabbath of May. It is a special day to let our Adventurers enjoy being Adventurers and to show others the blessing they are to our church and our community. Make sure to check on this page regularly on the months leading up to World Adventurer Day for resources created specifically for you to use in your local church and centered on the theme for that specific year.
