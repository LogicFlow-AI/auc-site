<p><em>Devotions from the&nbsp;Aisles</em>&nbsp;written by Amanda&nbsp;Bews&nbsp;is a compilation of 26 devotional stories that feature common brands&nbsp;that&nbsp;would be found&nbsp;on the shelf in the supermarket.&nbsp;Each supermarket item&nbsp;is paired&nbsp;with a spiritual lesson&nbsp;as well as questions that prompt the reader to reflect on the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Ms Bews, the book brings stories and lessons from the Christian innovators who created the brands found in supermarkets. “Greta Pratt shared the stories with her children so when they saw the items in the supermarket, they would&nbsp;be reminded&nbsp;of these important values,” said Ms Bews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second book,<em>&nbsp;Advent&nbsp;Oarsmen: The Robert &amp; Henry McMahon Story,</em>&nbsp;also written by Amanda Bews, is the seventh book in<em>&nbsp;The Angel Said Australia</em>&nbsp;series featuring the true story of Robert and Henry McMahon who rowed their boat from Cunninghame, Victoria (now Lakes Entrance) to Coogee beach, New South Wales, with nothing but cold pies, a school atlas and a pile of books.</p>

<p>“<em>Advent Oarsmen</em>&nbsp;is an incredible story of tenacity and reliance on God in overwhelming circumstances. God protected Robert and Henry on their treacherous journey&nbsp;and&nbsp;He will be with us too,” said Ms Bews.</p>
